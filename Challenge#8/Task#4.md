# **Task #36: Detect SQL Injection Attempts in Apache Logs Using Splunk**  

## **Objective**  
The goal of this task is to help students **identify SQL injection attempts** in Apache logs using Splunk. SQL injection is a web attack technique where malicious SQL statements are injected into input fields to manipulate a database. By analyzing web server logs, students will detect **unauthorized database query attempts**.

## **Lab Setup**  

### **Requirements**  
- **System:** Ubuntu 22.04/20.04 (Splunk Server)  
- **Tools Required:**  
  - **Splunk Enterprise or Splunk Cloud**  
  - **Apache Web Server Logs (`access.log`)**  

### **Preparation**  

**Step 1: Ensure Apache Logs Are Ingested into Splunk**  
1. If logs are stored locally, upload them manually:  
   ```splunk
   | inputlookup apache_logs.csv
If logs are forwarded via Splunk Universal Forwarder, ensure they are indexed correctly:
splunk
Copy
Edit
index=web sourcetype=apache_access
Attack Simulation & Detection Using Splunk
We will now detect malicious SQL queries embedded in HTTP requests.

Step 1: Detect Common SQL Injection Payloads in URLs
Run this query to find requests containing SQL keywords that indicate injection attempts:

splunk
Copy
Edit
index=web sourcetype=apache_access request="*UNION*" OR request="*SELECT*" OR request="*DROP*" OR request="*INSERT*" OR request="*UPDATE*" OR request="*DELETE*"
ðŸš¨ Attackers may be trying to execute unauthorized SQL queries, bypass authentication, or dump database tables.

Step 2: Identify the Most Frequent SQL Injection Attempts
Run this query to analyze which SQL-based attack patterns appear most often:

splunk
Copy
Edit
index=web sourcetype=apache_access request="*UNION*" OR request="*SELECT*"
| stats count by request
| sort -count
ðŸš¨ Frequent SQL queries in URLs indicate a possible automated SQL injection attack.

Step 3: Extract IP Addresses Involved in SQL Injection Attempts
Run this query to list IPs making suspicious SQL queries:

splunk
Copy
Edit
index=web sourcetype=apache_access request="*UNION*" OR request="*SELECT*" OR request="*DROP*"
| stats count by client_ip
| sort -count
ðŸš¨ Repeated SQL injection attempts from the same IP suggest an attacker or botnet is targeting the web application.

Conclusion
âœ… Successfully detected SQL injection attempts using Apache logs in Splunk.
âœ… Identified malicious SQL queries and potential exploitation attempts.
âœ… Extracted top offending IPs executing SQL-based payloads.
âœ… Learned how SOC analysts monitor and prevent SQL injection-based attacks.
