# **Task #37: Detect Suspicious User Agents in Apache Logs Using Splunk**  

## **Objective**  
The goal of this task is to help students **identify suspicious or malicious user agents** in Apache logs using Splunk. Attackers, web scrapers, and bots often use unusual or forged user agents to evade detection. By analyzing web server logs, students will detect **automated scanning, scraping, and potential attack attempts**.

## **Lab Setup**  

### **Requirements**  
- **System:** Ubuntu 22.04/20.04 (Splunk Server)  
- **Tools Required:**  
  - **Splunk Enterprise or Splunk Cloud**  
  - **Apache Web Server Logs (`access.log`)**  

### **Preparation**  

**Step 1: Ensure Apache Logs Are Ingested into Splunk**  
1. If logs are stored locally, upload them manually:  
   ```splunk
   | inputlookup apache_logs.csv
If logs are forwarded via Splunk Universal Forwarder, ensure they are indexed correctly:
splunk
Copy
Edit
index=web sourcetype=apache_access
Attack Simulation & Detection Using Splunk
We will now detect unusual user agents that may indicate bot activity, scrapers, or attackers.

Step 1: List the Most Common User Agents
Run this query to identify the most frequently used user agents in Apache logs:

splunk
Copy
Edit
index=web sourcetype=apache_access
| stats count by user_agent
| sort -count
ðŸš¨ Legitimate traffic usually comes from browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. Look for anomalies.

Step 2: Detect Rare or Suspicious User Agents
Run this query to filter non-standard or potentially malicious user agents:

splunk
Copy
Edit
index=web sourcetype=apache_access NOT user_agent="Mozilla*" NOT user_agent="Chrome*" NOT user_agent="Safari*"
| stats count by user_agent
| sort -count
ðŸš¨ Requests from curl, wget, python-requests, or empty user agents may indicate automation, scanning, or scraping.

Step 3: Identify Top IPs Using Suspicious User Agents
Run this query to correlate user agents with IP addresses:

splunk
Copy
Edit
index=web sourcetype=apache_access NOT user_agent="Mozilla*" NOT user_agent="Chrome*" NOT user_agent="Safari*"
| stats count by client_ip, user_agent
| sort -count
ðŸš¨ If an IP is using multiple suspicious user agents, it may be an attacker or a botnet.

Conclusion
âœ… Successfully detected suspicious user agents using Apache logs in Splunk.
âœ… Identified bots, scrapers, or automated scanners.
âœ… Correlated malicious user agents with specific IP addresses.
âœ… Learned how SOC analysts monitor web traffic to detect and prevent automated attacks.
