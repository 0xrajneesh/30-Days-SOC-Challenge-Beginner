# **Task #33: Detect High Number of 404 Errors (Reconnaissance Attempts) Using Splunk**  

## **Objective**  
The goal of this task is to help students **detect reconnaissance attempts** where attackers probe a web server for non-existent resources, often leading to **multiple 404 errors**. By analyzing Apache access logs in Splunk, students will identify **potential attackers scanning for vulnerabilities**.

## **Lab Setup**  

### **Requirements**  
- **System:** Ubuntu 22.04/20.04 (Splunk Server)  
- **Tools Required:**  
  - **Splunk Enterprise or Splunk Cloud**  
  - **Apache Web Server Logs (`access.log`)**  

### **Preparation**  

**Ensure Apache Logs Are Ingested into Splunk**  
1. If logs are stored locally, upload them manually:  
   ```splunk
   | inputlookup apache_logs.csv
   ```
2. If logs are forwarded via Splunk Universal Forwarder, ensure they are indexed correctly:
   ```splunk
   index=web sourcetype=apache_access
   ```

## Attack Simulation & Detection Using Splunk
We will now detect high-frequency 404 errors, which may indicate reconnaissance activity.

### Step 1: Detect IPs Generating Multiple 404 Errors
Run this query to identify IPs that repeatedly request non-existent pages:
```
index=web sourcetype=apache_access status=404
| stats count by client_ip
| sort -count
```
ðŸš¨ Attackers often scan for missing pages (e.g., /admin, /login, /backup.zip).

### Step 2: Identify Scanning Behavior Over Time
Run this query to analyze 404 errors by time to detect aggressive scanning patterns:
```
index=web sourcetype=apache_access status=404
| timechart span=5m count by client_ip
```
ðŸš¨ A sudden spike in 404 errors may indicate an automated scanner or bot performing reconnaissance.

### Step 3: Identify the Most Requested Non-Existent Pages
Run this query to list the most frequently requested URLs that returned a 404 error:

```
index=web sourcetype=apache_access status=404
| stats count by request
| sort -count
```
ðŸš¨ If many requests are targeting sensitive directories like /wp-admin/ or /config.php, attackers may be scanning for vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion
âœ… Successfully detected reconnaissance activity using Apache logs in Splunk.    
âœ… Identified top attacking IPs repeatedly triggering 404 errors.    
âœ… Analyzed common scanning patterns and targeted pages.    
âœ… Learned how SOC analysts monitor for reconnaissance attempts using Splunk.    

## Submission
- Share a screenshot of the Splunk query results showing frequent 404 errors.   
- Share a screenshot of the time-based trend analysis for 404 errors.
