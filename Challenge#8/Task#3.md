# **Task #35: Detect Directory Traversal Attacks in Apache Logs Using Splunk**  

## **Objective**  
The goal of this task is to help students **identify directory traversal attacks** in Apache logs using Splunk. Attackers use **`../` sequences** in URLs to attempt accessing restricted files outside the web root directory. By analyzing web server logs, students will detect **unauthorized attempts to access system files**.

## **Lab Setup**  

### **Requirements**  
- **System:** Ubuntu 22.04/20.04 (Splunk Server)  
- **Tools Required:**  
  - **Splunk Enterprise or Splunk Cloud**  
  - **Apache Web Server Logs (`access.log`)**  

### **Preparation**  

**Step 1: Ensure Apache Logs Are Ingested into Splunk**  
1. If logs are stored locally, upload them manually:  
   ```splunk
   | inputlookup apache_logs.csv
   ```
2. If logs are forwarded via Splunk Universal Forwarder, ensure they are indexed correctly:
   ```
   index=web sourcetype=apache_access
   ```

## Attack Simulation & Detection Using Splunk
We will now detect directory traversal attempts, where attackers try to access files outside the web root.

### Step 1: Detect Directory Traversal Attempts in Requests
Run this query to find requests containing ../ sequences:

```
index=web sourcetype=apache_access request="*../*" OR request="*../../*"
```
ðŸš¨ Directory traversal attacks attempt to access sensitive files like /etc/passwd or C:\windows\system32\.

### Step 2: Identify the Most Targeted Files
Run this query to analyze which files attackers are trying to access:

```
index=web sourcetype=apache_access request="*../*"
| stats count by request
| sort -count
```
ðŸš¨ If requests frequently target /etc/passwd or .htaccess, attackers may be attempting privilege escalation.

### Step 3: Extract IP Addresses Attempting Directory Traversal
Run this query to list IPs making directory traversal attempts:

```
index=web sourcetype=apache_access request="*../*"
| stats count by client_ip
| sort -count
```
ðŸš¨ Repeated requests from the same IP indicate an automated attack.

## Conclusion
âœ… Successfully detected directory traversal attacks using Apache logs in Splunk.    
âœ… Identified top targeted files and source IPs attempting traversal.    
âœ… Analyzed attack frequency and common traversal techniques.   
âœ… Learned how SOC analysts monitor web logs to prevent unauthorized file access.   

## Submission
