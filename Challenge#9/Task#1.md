# **Task #1: Setting up Osquery on Ubuntu Server**  

## **Objective**  
The goal of this task is to help students **install and configure Osquery on an Ubuntu Server** for system monitoring and security auditing. Osquery allows users to query system information using SQL-like queries, making it a powerful tool for **threat hunting, forensic analysis, and compliance monitoring**.

## **Lab Setup**  

### **Requirements**  
- **System:** Ubuntu 22.04/20.04 (Target Machine)  
- **Tools Required:**  
  - **Osquery (To query system logs and security events)**  
  - **Terminal (Command-line access to the Ubuntu machine)**  

---

## **Installation & Configuration**  

We will now install **Osquery** and configure it for system monitoring.

### **Step 1: Add the Osquery Repository**  
Run the following command to add the official **Osquery repository**:  
```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 1484120AC4E9F8A1A577AEEE97A80C63C9D8B80B
```
ðŸš¨ This imports the Osquery GPG key to verify package authenticity.

### Step 2: Install Osquery
Run these commands to install Osquery on Ubuntu:

```
sudo add-apt-repository 'deb [arch=amd64] https://pkg.osquery.io/deb deb main'
sudo apt update
sudo apt install osquery -y
```
ðŸš¨ Osquery is now installed and ready for use.

### Step 3: Start Osquery Interactive Shell
Launch Osqueryâ€™s interactive shell to execute commands:

```
osqueryi
```
Run a test query to check logged-in users:

```
SELECT * FROM users;
```
ðŸš¨ If the output displays system users, Osquery is working correctly.

### Step 4: Enable and Start Osquery Daemon (osqueryd)
To allow continuous system monitoring, enable and start the Osquery service:
```
sudo systemctl enable osqueryd
sudo systemctl start osqueryd
```
Verify the status of the Osquery daemon:

```
sudo systemctl status osqueryd
```
ðŸš¨ The service should be active and running.

### Step 5: Configure Osquery for System Monitoring
- Modify the Osquery configuration file to enable system logging:

```
sudo nano /etc/osquery/osquery.conf
```
- Add the following configuration to log system activity:

```
{
  "options": {
    "config_plugin": "filesystem",
    "logger_plugin": "filesystem",
    "logger_path": "/var/log/osquery/",
    "schedule_splay_percent": 10,
    "events_expiry": 3600,
    "database_path": "/var/osquery/osquery.db",
    "disable_events": false
  }
}
```
Save and exit the file (CTRL + X, then Y, then ENTER).

- Restart Osquery to apply changes:

```
sudo systemctl restart osqueryd
```
ðŸš¨ Osquery is now set up for logging system activity.

## Conclusion
âœ… Successfully installed Osquery on an Ubuntu Server.   
âœ… Configured Osquery daemon for system monitoring.   
âœ… Executed basic Osquery commands to query system information.   
âœ… Learned how SOC analysts use Osquery for security monitoring and forensic analysis.   

## Submission
- Share a screenshot of Osquery running a test query (SELECT * FROM users;).   
- Share a screenshot of the Osquery configuration file (/etc/osquery/osquery.conf).    
- Write a short observation on how Osquery helps in system security monitoring.
