# **Task #3: Osquery Basics - Collecting Scheduled Tasks on Ubuntu**  

## **Objective**  
The objective of this task is to help students **collect and analyze scheduled tasks (cron jobs) on an Ubuntu system using Osquery**. Scheduled tasks can be used for **system automation, but attackers may also leverage them for persistence and malware execution**. This task will teach students how to **query and investigate scheduled tasks for security monitoring**.

## **Preparation**  

### **Requirements**  
- **System:** Ubuntu 22.04/20.04 (Target Machine)  
- **Tools Required:**  
  - **Osquery (Installed and running - Refer to Task #1)**  
  - **Terminal (Command-line access to Ubuntu machine)**  

### **Step 1: Ensure Osquery Is Installed and Running**  
1. Verify Osquery installation:  
   ```bash
   osqueryi --version

2. Start Osquery interactive shell:
```
osqueryi
```

## Attack Simulation and Investigation
### Step 1: Simulate an Unauthorized Scheduled Task
1. Create a malicious cron job that executes a hidden script:
```
echo "* * * * * root /tmp/malicious.sh" | sudo tee -a /etc/crontab
```
2. This command adds a scheduled task that runs every minute.

### Step 2: Collect System-Wide Scheduled Tasks
Run this Osquery query to list all scheduled cron jobs:

```
SELECT * FROM crontab;
```
ðŸš¨ Look for unexpected or unauthorized entries.

### Step 3: Identify Scheduled Tasks for Specific Users
Run this query to identify scheduled tasks running under a specific user:

```
SELECT user, command FROM crontab WHERE user != 'root';
```
ðŸš¨ If non-root users have suspicious scheduled jobs, it could indicate persistence techniques.



## Conclusion
âœ… Successfully collected and analyzed scheduled tasks using Osquery.    
âœ… Simulated an unauthorized cron job and detected it using Osquery queries.    
âœ… Identified suspicious scheduled jobs running from hidden locations.   
âœ… Learned how SOC analysts monitor scheduled tasks to detect persistence mechanisms.    

Submission
Share a screenshot of Osquery running the query to list all scheduled tasks.
