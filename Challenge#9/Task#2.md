# **Task #2: Query Running Processes to Detect Unauthorized Applications Using Osquery**  

## **Objective**  
The objective of this task is to help students **detect unauthorized or suspicious applications running on an Ubuntu server** using Osquery. By querying system processes, students will learn how to **identify rogue applications, detect unauthorized privilege escalations, and monitor unusual command executions**.

---

## **Preparation**  

### **Requirements**  
- **System:** Ubuntu 22.04/20.04 (Target Machine)  
- **Tools Required:**  
  - **Osquery (Installed and running - Refer to Task #1)**  
  - **Terminal (Command-line access to Ubuntu machine)**  

### Ensure Osquery Is Installed and Running**  
1. Verify Osquery installation:  
   ```bash
   osqueryi --version
   ```
2. Start Osquery interactive shell:
```
osqueryi
```

## Attack Simulation and Investigation

### Step 1: Simulate an Unauthorized Process Execution
1. Run a simulated unauthorized process in the background:
```
nohup bash -c 'sleep 600' &
```
2. This will create a long-running hidden process, which attackers often use for persistence.

### Step 2: Detect All Running Processes
Run this query to list all active processes on the system:

```
SELECT pid, name, path, cmdline, start_time FROM processes;
```
ðŸš¨ Look for unknown or suspicious applications running on the system.

### Step 3: Detect Non-Standard Applications
Run this query to find processes executing from unusual locations:

```
SELECT pid, name, path FROM processes WHERE path NOT LIKE "/usr/bin/%" AND path NOT LIKE "/bin/%";
```
ðŸš¨ Processes running from /tmp, /dev/shm, or user directories may indicate malware or unauthorized software.


### Conclusion
âœ… Successfully queried running processes using Osquery.    
âœ… Simulated an unauthorized process execution and detected it using Osquery.    
âœ… Identified suspicious applications, unauthorized root processes, and risky command executions.    
âœ… Learned how SOC analysts use process monitoring to detect unauthorized activity.
